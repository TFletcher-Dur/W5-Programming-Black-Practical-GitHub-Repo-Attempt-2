<h1>AI and It's Involvement in Research</h1>
<div>
<h3><i>Outside</i> of just generative AI; AI is an incredibly broad topic and tool.</h3>
<p>Large language models such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, etc have been in the news a lot lately; in fact, it seems every app
    is trying to push generative AI into it, such as seen in Whatsapp, which blatantly does not need an informative AI.
</p>
<p>We do have other uses of AI, however, including the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Climate change modelling using AI</li>
    <li>Cancer research that utilises AI</li>
    <li>Literally every video game to exist uses AI for its character and enemy pathing. This is still AI.</li>
    <li>Chess AIs, for example, that can be used in training and learning skills. See Machine Learning for more.</li>
</ul>
<p>And yet AI has a terrible reputation, due to the environmental and social costs of mainly these LLMs. There's always
    been opposition to new technologies and strategies, but often these fears have justifications. During the early days of
    power lines, for example, the sheer mass of wires above ground was genuinely terrifying, so pushback was initially justified.</p>

<p>So it's important to consider the validity in people's claims. It's also important to draw attention away from one focal point;
    after all, maybe it's a point of question why all the focus and money is going towards environmentally destructive AIs that do jobs that
    are already being done.
