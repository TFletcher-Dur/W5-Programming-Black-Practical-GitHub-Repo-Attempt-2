    <h1>The Impact Of Technology On Entertainment</h1>

    <p>
        One key area in which computing has had a significant impact is the entertainment industry. Technology can be used in the 
        entertainment industry for a diverse range of applications, for example distribution of media or tools allowing for new forms 
        of entertainment to be created
    </p>

    <h2>The digital entertainment industry</h2>
    <p>
        Digital entertainment has become a huge global industry, with revenue made from digital entertainment estimated to 
        exceed 1 trillion in 2025 [1]. Multiple Fortune 500 companies are either based on (e.g. netflix and disney) or have a significant 
        presence in (e.g. alphabet with youtube, apple with appleTV). Digital entertainment refers to any form of entertainment that 
        is primarily delivered through digital technology.

                One of the largest industries to come from the digital entertainment industry is the streaming industry. 
            </td>
            <td>
                An industry that would have been entirely impossible without digital technology is the 
                videogames industry. 
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Independant media</h2>

    <p>
        Another major change to entertainment made possible through improvements in technology is the rise of independant media

    <p>
        One way technology has made it much easier and cheaper for people with a limited budget and with a limited/single person team size to
        make many forms of media such as movies and videogames.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another major way technology has enabled independant media is through making it far easier to distribute and advertise the technology.
