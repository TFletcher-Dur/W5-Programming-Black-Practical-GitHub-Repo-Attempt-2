    <h2>The digital entertainment industry</h2>
    <p>
        Digital entertainment has become a huge global industry, with revenue made from digital entertainment estimated to 
        exceed 1 trillion in 2025 [1]. Multiple Fortune 500 companies are either based on (e.g. netflix and disney) or have a significant 
        presence in (e.g. alphabet with youtube, apple with appleTV). Digital entertainment refers to any form of entertainment that 
        is primarily delivered through digital technology. 
    </p>

    <table>
        <caption>
            There are many different branches of the digital entertainment industry, including:
        </caption>
        <tr>
            <th>Steaming</th>
            <th>Video Games</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>       
                One of the largest industries to come from the digital entertainment industry is the streaming industry. 
            </td>
            <td>
                An industry that would have been entirely impossible without digital technology is the 
                videogames industry. 
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Independant media</h2>

    <p>
        Another major change to entertainment made possible through improvements in technology is the rise of independant media
    <p>
    <img src = "../images/Stardew_valley.jpg" alt = "Image of the game Stardew Valley" style: float:left>
    <p>
        One way technology has made it much easier and cheaper for people with a limited budget and with a limited/single person team size to
        make many forms of media such as movies and videogames.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another major way technology has enabled independant media is through making it far easier to distribute and advertise the technology.
