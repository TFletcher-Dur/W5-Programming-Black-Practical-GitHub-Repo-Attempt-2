                    According to its creator Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web - or in other words,
                    the method which the majority of people use to access web pages and Internet 
                    communication services to this day - was originally created as a "universal linked 
                    information system". 
                    <sup><a href="#wwwWikipedia">1</a></sup> Developed at CERN, it was initially
                    intended mainly as a means for researchers to share information across the world,
                    much like the Internet itself, 
                    <sup><a href="#wwwCERN">2</a> <a href="#internetWikipedia">3</a></sup>
                    however was also intended to be an open standard for all to use rather than a
                    proprietary system owned by a small number of organisations. 
                    <sup><a href="#wwwCERN">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The world's first Web Browser was (for obvious reasons) the one used by the CERN
                    researchers themselves, designed to run on the powerful
                    <a 
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT_Computer"
                    title="NeXT Computer - Wikipedia"
                    >NeXT computers</a>
                    available at the CERN laboratories and in some other research settings (as one might
                    expect of a system designed primarily for research purposes) and used at the time
                    mainly to access important information such as guides on how to operate the computers
                    and phonebooks for CERN and various other research institutions. NeXT computers being
                    powerful machines, few individual users had access to them, hence the early
                    World Wide Web was somewhat naturally restricted to being an information network
                    accessed almost exclusively by researchers.
                    <sup><a href="#wwwCERN">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soon, however, 
                    <a 
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Pellow"
                    title="Nicola Pellow - Wikipedia"
                    >Nicola Pellow</a>
                     - a student on a placement
                    at the laboratory who would ultimately go on to join the team full time and
                    co-develop the first web browser for the classic Mac OS - would develop the first
                    <a 
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_Mode_Browser"
                    title="Line Mode Browser - Wikipedia"
                    >"Line Mode Browser"</a>,
                    which displayed web pages in a text-only format and was developed in the by then
                    relatively (although not fully) standardised C programming language and widely
                    adapted such that it could be used on almost every platform available at the time.
                    This brought the World Wide Web to a larger audience than ever before, with it
                    then being able to run (albeit in a rather user-unfriendly manner) on the home
                    computers possessed by many families across the world. 
                    <sup><a href="#wwwCERN">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The release of the Line Mode Browser and its relatively widespread use by independent
                    users soon made it clear to Berners-Lee and the others at CERN that the project
                    of developing and expanding the World Wide Web was no longer one which they could
                    achieve alone. As such, in keeping with the open source nature of the project as a
                    whole, Berners-Lee sent out a plea to the other early users of the Internet via the
                    homepage for the entire World Wide Web project and the first ever public Web Page at
                    <a

                    (the page being maintained at the same address as always to this day due to its
                    status as an important part of the history of the World Wide Web, 
                    a system which has had such a profound impact on our society since its conception)
                    asking them to develop new, better browsers with which to access the World Wide Web.
                    Many users of the web would respond to this plea, writing 
                    user-friendly browsers for various different platforms, the existence of these
                    browsers rendering the World Wide Web accessible to an ever growing number of ever
                    more casual users.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University
                    of Illinois released its Mosaic Browser for various platforms and CERN published the
                    original WWW browser as an open-source, royalty-free program, and by the end of 1994,
                    thanks to these systems among others, the World Wide Web had over 10 million users
                    and over 10 thousand servers, 20 percent of which were even run commercially rather
                    than academically. From there, as is clear to tell from the very fact that you are
                    reading this page via the World Wide Web in some regard now, the World Wide Web
                    would only continue to grow, connecting together more and more people and fulfilling
                    its role of allowing for the sharing of information - both academic and otherwise
                    - across the world.

                </p>
                <p>
                    To give some statistics, the World Wide Web comprises over 
                    1,119,023,272 websites <sup><a href="#numSites">4</a></sup> (this being the
                    estimated number of sites as of the 28th of May 2025), with 3 new websites being
                    created every second on average. <sup><a href="#webStats"></a>5</sup> Across the
                    world, an estimated 6.04 billion people use the Internet, this being around 73.2%
                    of the global population. <sup><a href="#internetUsers">6</a></sup> As such,
                    it is almost undeniable to say that the Internet has spread rapidly and had a 
                    drastic and permanent impact on society since its conception, as well as that the
                    World Wide Web remains true to its goal of being an open standard and framework for 
                    communication to this day in its status as a highly accessible means for users 
                    across the world to communicate with each other, 
                    its accessibility being exemplified by the over 5.66 billion social media
                    accounts across the world. <sup><a href="#internetUsers">6</a></sup>

                    With time, the Internet would expand across the world, connecting people of various

                    via a variety of means, creating websites such as the
