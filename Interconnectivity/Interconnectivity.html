                <div class="fakeimg">Fake Image</div>
                <p>
                    According to its creator Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web - or in other words,
                    the method which the majority of people use to access Internet communication
                    services to this day - was originally created as a "universal linked information 
                    system"<sup><a href="#wwwWikipedia">1</a></sup>. Developed at CERN, it was initially
                    intended mainly as a means for researchers to share information across the world,
                    much like the Internet itself, which was developed for the same purpose
                    <sup><a href="#wwwCERN">2</a> <a href="#internetWikipedia">3</a></sup>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over time, however, due to the necessity of allowing public contributors to create
                    their own browsers to allow for faster development and the wish to keep the service
                    publically accessible, the service was released to the public, this leading to
                    the communication between users via various different means across the Internet
                    and particularly the World Wide Web that we see today: recall that web pages such
                    as forums, for example, are still hosted via the World Wide Web, as demonstrated
                    by the "www" at the beginning of their web addresses, and that it is the Voice Over
                    Internet Protocol (VOIP) which allows us to call others across the world.

                <h2 class="mt-5">The Internet As A Conduit For Cultural and Subcultural Exchanges</h2>
                <h5>Title description, Sep 2, 2020</h5>
                <div class="fakeimg">Fake Image</div>
                <p>
                    With time, the Internet would expand across the world, connecting people of various
                    different cultures speaking various different languages, who inevitably interacted
                    via a variety of means, creating websites such as the 
                    <a href="https://forum.wordreference.com/">WordReference Forums</a>
                    which allow for the exchange of cultural and linguistic knowledge, among other,
                    less serious forums such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Internet has also, almost since its conception, facilitated subcultural exchanges
                    via forums such as 
                    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> (among other locations)
                    which have connected together various communities and allowed them to grow, as
                    discussed in the context of the LGBTQ+ community in Japan by Erica Friedman
                    <sup><a href="#ericafriedman">4</a></sup>
