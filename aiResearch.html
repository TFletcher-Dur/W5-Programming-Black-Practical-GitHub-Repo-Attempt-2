<h1>AI and It's Involvement in Research</h1>
<h3><i>Outside</i> of just generative AI; of all the uses of AI, people really go in on the least useful ones.</h3>
<p>Large language models such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, etc have been in the news a lot lately; in fact, it seems every app
    is trying to push generative AI into it, such as seen in Whatsapp, which blatantly does not need an informative AI.
