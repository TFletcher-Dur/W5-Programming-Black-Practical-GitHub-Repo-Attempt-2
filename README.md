# A Note Regarding The "review-67" Branch
The "review-67" branch is a snapshot of our work as it was at the time of the creation of "review_67.md" by another group. I have preserved it in this state on this branch to demonstrate the reasons for the comments made in said review and hence allow us to show the progress which was made to resolve said comments after the receipt of the initial review.

Note that at the point of the review, due to various issues such as problems with git and our overall inexperience with collaboration, this project was not finished, however that we resolved to finish it in our own time so as to correct the problems which remained in it at this point.
